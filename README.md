# Employee Tracker App

Welcome to the Employee Tracker App! This app is designed to help employers create a directory of all of their managers, engineers, and interns. The directory will be displayed via an HTML page that is generated through the use of node.

To install the application, user will need to load the following dependencies through their terminal.

Once the dependencies have been downloaded, the user is ready to open the integrated terminal through the index.js file and get started!

# Usage

To use this application, the user will need to go through the prompted questions in their terminal. Once completed, the program will automatically generate an HTML file that can be opened using their default browser.

# Issues

The biggest issue I am running into is the "undefined" when generating the extra item in the js. Any suggestions are welcome!
